## Hello, nice to meet you

You are probably looking for a fully working implementation of Erlang/OTP in Java.

Well, this would be a good description of JErlang's goal,
but unfortunately,
this project is currently in a very early stage and still far away from being usable.
Sorry to disappoint you.

We are always looking for contributors.<br>
If you want to help, [you are welcome](https://github.com/jerlang/jerlang)!
