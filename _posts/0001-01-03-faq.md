To learn the Erlang from scratch.

### When will it be production ready?

Not anytime soon. See the [roadmap](https://github.com/jerlang/jerlang/blob/master/README.md) for current status.

### Are there alternatives?

Yes, [Erjang](https://github.com/trifork/erjang) is another Erlang implementation in Java.

It is a great project, but not under active development anymore.
